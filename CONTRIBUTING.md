## Indentation ##
Please use tabs for indentation. It really doesn't matter, but I always use tabs, and it would be better to keep everything the same.

## Brackets ##
Please have opening brackets on the same line as the code, and the ending bracket on its own line. Again, it doesn't really matter, but I always do it this way, and I would like to keep it the same throughoug the entire project.

## Issues ##
If you find a problem in the code, please submit an issue. Please make sure you:
* Describe the problem
* Show how to reproduce it, if applicable
* Explain what you think is causing it, if applicable
* Give a plausible solution

## Commits ##
Commits should be in the present tense, in a sentence, and preferably less than 50 characters, e.g. "Add some new feature."  If needed, a body to the commit can be on the next line.
